       <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Yet again, a powerful tablet for work and play</h2>
       <p>The iPad Pro's hardware continues to overpower the software. Although, with the addition of Stage Manager in iPadOS 16.1 and true external monitor support included in iPadOS 16.2 -- which is due for release before the end of the year, iPad Pro users have more hope than ever that the iPad is about to turn the corner. 

        In my early hands-on preview of iPadOS 16, I wrote that the update fundamentally changed the way I use my iPad Pro. For the better, and I stand by that. I admittedly gave Apple the benefit of the doubt that any issues I'd experienced during early testing were bugs in a young beta and that by the time the official release arrived, those bugs would be ironed out. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. </p>
        <img src="ipad2.jpg" alt="">
        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">The Apple Pencil's hover feature is neat</h2>
        <p>Outside of the iPad Pro now coming with the M2 Apple Silicon processor, there's not a whole lot that's new with the 2022 model. That said, if you're an Apple Pencil user, you'll notice a trick that, so far, has been a very subtle addition during my use. 

            There's a new coprocessor in the M2 chip that's dedicated to handling interactions with the second-generation Apple Pencil. It monitors when the tip of the Pencil gets near the iPad Pro's display -- within 12 millimeters -- to proc unique app interactions via the new hover feature. 
            
            In the Notes app, for example, that means you'll see a small preview of what the selected tool will look like when you put the tip of the pencil to the screen. In my case, when using the pen tool to take notes, a small black dot mirrors the Pencil's movement above the display. In apps that support this feature, you can even hover the Apple Pencil over the screen and use the double-tap gesture to trigger additional actions. 
            
            At times, hover has been obvious -- such as when in the Notes app -- but other times, I haven't noticed it at all, or it just hasn't been present when I'd expect to see it. 
            
            For example, when using the iPad's Scribble feature, the text field is supposed to get bigger as you write with the Pencil, and then shrink back to its original size after you're done writing and it's converted to text. I've only seen that happen in the Messages app, but not in places like Safari's address bar where it would be helpful. Maybe I'm just doing it wrong?
            
            Apple did announce tools for third-party developers to integrate hover into their apps, and maybe once more developers have had time to add integration, hover will work as users expect in nearly every app and interface. But right now, it feels like a good feature that's in need of discoverability. </p>
