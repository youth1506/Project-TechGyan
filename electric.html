    <div class="p"><p> Electric scooters in India are available in all shapes and sizes. To help you find the right one, we have compiled a list of the best electric scooters available in India right now. The list comprises e-scooters from established and new companies. These scooters are not only environment-friendly but have lower maintenance and running cost compared to their ICE variants. What’s more, some of the electric scooters, if not all, are now matching their petrol variants, and with government subsidies from the centre and state – subject to change, you can further bring the cost down. On that note, here are our top 10 electric scooters</p></div >
        <h2>Best electric scooters you can buy in India</h2>
        <div class="p">
            <p>There are several types of electric scooters available in India, including some, which don’t even require you to have a license to drive. In this list, we have covered electric scooters that can handle the daily needs of an average scooter user in India. We have also made sure to include electric scooters targeting all price points so you can get one that fits your budget.</p>

    <img src="ather.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="p">
       <p>In July 2022, Ather Energy updated its flagship electric scooter with the third generation iteration, dubbed the Ather Energy 450x Gen 3. The scooter offers a more powerful electric motor that can produce an equivalent of 8.7 bhp of power and an ARAI-certified riding range of 146 km. Not only this, Ather’s already well-engineered scooter body is now even better built thanks to an all-aluminium frame. It also gets a new tread profile for the tyres, as well as a new tyre pressure monitoring system accessory. Even its digital dashboard has been upgraded with more RAM to make operations smoother and easier. All things considered, the Ather 450x Gen 3 is arguably the best electric scooter that you can buy in India. From ride quality to build and overall experience, this is one of the most premium electric scooters on Indian roads right now.</p>

    <div class="price">
        <h3>Ather Energy 450x Gen 3 price in India, pros and cons</h3>
        <p>The Ather electric scooter is selling in India at Rs 1,37,612 onward (depending on the city of purchase).</p>
        <ul>
                <h3>pros</h3>
                <li>One of the most premium scooters</li>
                <li> Good riding range and speed</li>
                <li> Best-in-class features</li>

    <img src="scooty2.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="p">
       <p>Hero Electric, not to be confused with Hero Motocorp, is still one of the most recognisable names in the EV industry at the moment. Rightfully, the Sohinder Singh Gill-led company is one of the most popular when it comes to electric scooters on Indian roads, and one of the company’s most reliable workhorses is the Hero Electric Optima CX. We particularly recommend the dual-battery model of the scooter, which offers an excellent certified range of 140 km per charge cycle. It also has a detachable battery, which makes it even more convenient as you can charge the battery when at home — without needing a mobile charging station, necessarily. The scooter can travel at a peak speed of 45 kmph, thereby being rated as ideal for city commutes. You also get features such as a digital instrument cluster and a USB port for charging your mobile device, and regenerative braking for increasing your riding range.</p>

    <img src="scooty3.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="p">
       <p>Bajaj Chetak was one of the most prominent and popular scooter brands in the past, and now the company is reviving it in its electric form. The scooter’s design is an amalgamation of its old heritage and new modern aesthetics, and it looks beautiful. Talking about the specs, it has a range of 90 kilometres with the battery rated to last for 70,000 kilometres or 7 years. The battery has a quick charging feature that can charge up to 25 percent in only an hour, with a full charge taking 5 hours. Its steel body is built to last and comes with IP67 water and dust-resistant rating. There’s no doubt it’s a premium scooter, but its price is still too steep.</p>

    <div class="p">
       <p>The TVS iQube ST electric scooter stands out for looking more conventional, but that also comes with its own perks. For one, the iQube ST has one of the biggest boot spaces, capable of fitting two full-sized helmets to ensure safety for yourself and your companion. But, that’s not all. The scooter comes with a peak riding range of 145 km in economy mode, and 110 km in performance mode. When riding in the latter, the scooter can reach a pretty solid riding speed of 82 kmph, which makes it one of the best-performing electric scooters in the market. You also get a 7-inch touchscreen that offers Amazon Alexa voice assistant integration, music playback via Bluetooth, and even social media notifications on screen, while following all necessary safety measures to prevent you from being distracted. All things considered, the iQube ST from TVS is among the most robust and reliable electric scooters on the market, and it is even available in four colour variants!</p>

       <p>HereMotocorp’s sub-brand Vida earlier this month launched its first electric scooter named Vida V1. The scooter comes in two variants, Vida V1 Plus and Vida V1 Pro. Coming to the features and specs, both variants come with a top speed of 80 kmph but the V1 Pro can go from 0 to 40 kmph in 3.2 seconds while the V1 Plus takes 3.4 seconds for the same distance. As for the claimed range, the new EV two-wheelers will be able to deliver a range of 163 km and 143 km for V1 Pro and V1 Plus respectively. Running under the hood in both electric scooters is a portable battery pack that can be charged from 0 to 80 percent in less than 65 minutes. Furthermore, both the Vida V1 models come with a set of smart features such as parking assistance, location navigation, riding models, trip analytics and more all accessible via the 7-inch touch display.</p>
